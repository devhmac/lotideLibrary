### assertEqual

- Reconstructing a version of console.assert to verify if two items are equal to one another.
  - If passed, will output `` `âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ… Assertion Passed: ${actual} === ${expected}` ``
  - if Failed, will ouput `` `ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ Assertion Failed: ${actual} !== ${expected}` ``

### head

- Function returning the first item of an array, or _head_
  - Then utilized assertEqual to perform checks

### tail

- Function takes array as argument, returns new array with all values but the head.

### eqArrays
- compare arrays for equality, returning true/false, I check for any differences; if they exist, return false and if none exist, eqArrays returns true.

### assertArraysEqual
- Similar to assertEqual outputting a console.log stating pass or fail based on whether or not arrays are equal. 
  - Without a return function, had to reconfigure the eqArrays code to include conditional logic on outputting pass message.
